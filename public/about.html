<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 22 years old. Started to learn coding at this same age wanting something better for my life. I didn't want to sit all my life 
  doing nothing. I've always wanted to do big things and make sure that I can provide in the best way possible for my family. I'm a 
happy christan who also plays multiple different instruments for my church. It's amazing to serve God and I am never going to change it.</p>

  <p>I have't studied any type of coding before picking up this course. I'm in the call center industry and it's not really the type 
  of job I'm really wanting for the rest of my life. I told my wife and she has backed me up since to become one of the best coders 
  around.

<p>I live in Guatemala city but I'm actually from the US. I lived there all my life and I never really thought about changing my 
  lifestyle into something different. I found my beautiful wife in Antigua, Guatemala. It was the first moment that I saw her there 
  and I truly fell in love. Love at first sight you can say. It was one of the most important decisions of all my life and I knew 
  it wasn't going to be easy, but having the opportunity to have the love of my life next to me all the time is the best.
